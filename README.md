# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

**Project Type:** Internship Project  
**Duration:** May â€“ July 2025  
**Organization:** *IIT Kharagpur & StrategicERP, Mumbai*

---

## Overview

This project implements a **supervised machine learning pipeline** for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The system performs data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to accurately identify fraud patterns.

---

## Features

- Handles **class imbalance** and preprocesses transaction data for optimal model performance.  
- Trains multiple machine learning models for **binary classification**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
- Compares models using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Generates **visual reports** for detailed fraud analysis.
